## What is this?

This is upper management of client/server development setups with only minimum
dependencies to run scripts in `client` & `server` part of applications

## Note

Initially I wanted to manage eslint rules here, but this turns out to be bad
idea over the fact when I use apps created with `create-react-app` there is a
problem with version of `babel-eslint`
